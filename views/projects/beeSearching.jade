                h1 Bee Searching Project
                    h2 1. Motivation
                        p.
                            Bees are important living creature for flower to pollen. 
                            But in recent years, the number of bees reduce gradually. 
                            We hope we can use the microwave and positioning technology to find out reason for this phenomenon.
                    h2 2. Method
                        p Harmonic Radar
                        p.
                            - Emit high frequency RF wave. 
                            When RF wave hit the transponder on bees, the transponder will return a non-linear wave to our radar. 
                            This method can avoid some noise generated by leakage of RF wave from radar components.
                        p Psudo Random Code
                        p.
                            - Unlike pulse radar needs high energy to guarantee the energy of reflected pulse can be detected.
                            We encode Psudo Random Code to RF signal and measure the round trip time between the radar and the bee by the information from code.
                            Use this technology, we can search in larger range but less signal power.
                        p Positioning Algorithmsm
                        p. 
                            - We use correlator to detect the code in noisy signal. 
                            And transform the maximum correlation location to the distance between the bee and the radar.
                    h2 3. Experiment
                        p We experiment in a farm in Taipei. And use our system to find lab bees.
